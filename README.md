Read file types: .csv, .json, .txt.

Personal project to read all types of files(text,image,spreadsheets,graphs,webpages)
The goal is to develope skills using all sorts of python libraries necessary for data manipulation and visualization.

One use I have found useful is a tab script to store and open tabs to decrease the amount of memory Google Chrome uses while in the background.
I don't like the fact that an app to store webpages should be using so much memory, so I use this to decrease that burden on my devices.
